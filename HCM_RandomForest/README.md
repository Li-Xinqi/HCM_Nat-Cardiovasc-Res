## Requirements

We recommend using the [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) distribution for python dependencies. This code should work with Python 3. Besides, the following packages are required:

- numpy 
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## How to use

Put data in the `data` folder. And by following steps in `run.ipynb`, you can get results in outputs, and generated figures in the `figures` folder.
