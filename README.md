# Main
This project consists of three parts: the code for pictures„ÄÅRandom forest model for HCM diagnosis and Predict the survival outcomes of HCM patient using RSF method.

## the code for pictures
This code is used for drawing related pictures in the article.

## Random forest model for HCM diagnosis
We develop a Random forest model for HCM diagnosis. You can get more details in HCM_RandomForest directory.

## Predict the survival outcomes of HCM patient using RSF method
This part includes custom codes to predict the survival outcomes of HCM patients including all the 302 participants, 286 participants survived after surgery and 16 participants deceased after surgery. We built a prediction model by using Random Survival Forests (RSF) method.


More details were shown in the method section of the manuscript.
The data is available in the source data section of the manuscript.
Finally: We'd love to hear from you. Please let us know if you have any comments or suggestions, or if you have questions about the code or the procedure.
